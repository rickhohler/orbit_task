# orbit_task_platform_interface

A common platform interface for the `orbit_task` plugin.

This package defines the contract that platform-specific implementations (Android, iOS, Web) must adhere to.

## Usage

Unless you are building a platform implementation for OrbitTask, you do not need to use this package directly. Depend on `orbit_task` instead.
